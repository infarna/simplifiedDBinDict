You're embarking on creating a simplified version of a banking system, which involves a series of operations. These operations are laid out below for your reference. Progressing through this task involves tackling different levels, with each subsequent level unlocking once the current one is successfully completed. Access to data for both the current level and all preceding levels is always available to you.

Objective is to implement a simplified version of a banking system. Design is to accomodate different stages of specifications as below:

Stage 1: In-memory database should support basic operations to manipulate records, fields, and values within fields.
Stage 2: In-memory database should support displaying a record's fields based on a filter.
Stage 3: In-memory database should support the TTL (Time-To-Live) settings for records.
Stage 4: In-memory database should support look-back operations to retrieve values stored at a specific timestamp in the past.
